Using $(function(){}); is a shortcut to jQuery's document.ready function, which is fired once the DOM for the page has loaded.

Best practice is to alias the $ character within an automatically invoked anonymous function, or an immediately invoked function expression if you prefer. This can be done using the syntax (function($) { â€¦ }(jQuery));.

For best performance when using jQuery, it's best to select elements from the page and store them in variables instead of repeatedly selecting them from the page.

It is best practice to define variables at the top of the function they are scoped to because of a phenomenon known as hoisting, in which variables defined deep inside a function, inside a for loop for example, are "hoisted" to the top of the function in some situations, potentially causing errors that are hard to track down.

Any style properties that are usually defined using hyphenated words, such as background-image, should be camel-cased when used with jQuery's css() method in conjunction with an object.

jQuery's on() method, introduced in version 1.7, replaces the bind(), live(), and delegate() methods, which are now deprecated. Using on() is now the recommended way of attaching event handlers in jQuery.
